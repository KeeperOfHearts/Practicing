Create a function named classifyDeepSeaTemperature that receives temperature as its parameter.

As a scientist on a deep-sea expedition, you're using advanced thermometric equipment to measure ocean temperatures near a sunken research vessel. Your task is to classify the temperature readings into different categories.

Implement the function to classify the deep-sea temperature based on the following criteria:

    If the temperature is below 2°C, classify it as "Extremely Cold"
    If the temperature is between 2°C and 4°C (inclusive), classify it as "Cold"
    If the temperature is above 4°C and below 6°C, classify it as "Moderate"
    If the temperature is 6°C or above, classify it as "Warm"

Parameters:

    temperature (float): The temperature reading in Celsius from the deep-sea thermometric equipment.

The function returns a String representing the classification of the deep-sea temperature.
