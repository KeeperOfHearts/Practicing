Create a function named evaluateCropHealth that receives sensorData as its parameter.

This function analyzes the health of a cassava crop based on sensor data indicating whipworm activity. The sensor data is a boolean array where true means whipworm activity detected, and false means no activity.

Calculate the percentage of sensors detecting whipworm activity by counting the true values and dividing by the total number of sensors, then multiplying by 100.

Determine the crop's health based on the percentage:

    Less than 20%: "Healthy"
    20% to 50%: "Moderate"
    More than 50%: "Critical"

Parameters:

    sensorData (boolean[]): An array representing sensor outputs. true indicates whipworm activity detected, false means no activity.

The function returns a String: "Healthy", "Moderate", or "Critical".
