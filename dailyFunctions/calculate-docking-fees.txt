Create a function named calculateDockingFees that receives int days and boolean improperDocking as its parameters.

The function calculates the total cost of Lucius's docking fees based on the number of days he stays and his docking behavior.

Here's how the docking fees are calculated:

    The base fee for docking is $20 per day.
    If Lucius docked improperly, there's an additional fee of $15 per day.
    For every 5 days of stay, Lucius gets a discount of 5% on the total fee (before applying the improper docking fee).

Follow these steps to calculate the total docking fees:

    Calculate the initial total fee based on the number of days and the base rate.
    Apply the discount for every 5 days of stay.
    If Lucius docked improperly, add the additional fee.
    Return the final calculated fee.

Parameters:

    days (int): The number of days Lucius stays at the dock. It will be a positive integer.
    improperDocking (boolean): Indicates whether Lucius docked properly (false) or improperly (true).

The function returns a float representing the total cost of docking fees.
