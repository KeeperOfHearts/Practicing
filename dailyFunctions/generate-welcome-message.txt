Create a function named generateWelcomeMessage that receives name, age, and hasAppointment as its parameters.

This function aims to generate a personalized welcome message for visitors at a Scottish hospital based on their age and appointment status.

The friendly Scotsman at the reception desk wants to greet visitors differently depending on their situation:

    If the visitor has an appointment and is under 18, the message should be: "Ah, wee [name]! We've been expectin' ye. Right this way to your appointment, young one!"
    If the visitor has an appointment and is 18 or older, the message should be: "Welcome [name]! Thank ye for makin' an appointment. Please head to the reception."
    If the visitor does not have an appointment, regardless of age, the message should be: "Hello [name]! How can we assist ye today at our hospital?"

Implement the logic to generate the appropriate welcome message based on the provided parameters.

Parameters:

    name (String): The name of the visitor.
    age (int): The age of the visitor.
    hasAppointment (boolean): Indicates if the visitor has an appointment. true means they have an appointment, false means they don't.

The function should return a String representing the personalized welcome message.
