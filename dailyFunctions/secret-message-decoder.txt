class DecodeMessage {
    public static String decodeMessage(String sentence, int start1, int end1, int start2, int end2) {
        return sentence.substring(start2, end2+1) + sentence.substring(start1, end1+1);
    }
}

Create a function named decodeMessage that receives sentence, start1, end1, start2, and end2 as its parameters.

This function decodes a secret message hidden within the given sentence by extracting two substrings using the provided indices and concatenating them in a specific order.

Steps:

Extract the first substring using start1 and end1.
Extract the second substring using start2 and end2.
Concatenate the second substring followed by the first substring.
Return the concatenated string as the decoded message.
Parameters:

sentence (String): The sentence from which the substrings will be extracted.
start1 (int): The starting index (inclusive) of the first substring.
end1 (int): The ending index (inclusive) of the first substring.
start2 (int): The starting index (inclusive) of the second substring.
end2 (int): The ending index (inclusive) of the second substring.
The function returns the decoded secret message as a String.

Constraints:

The provided indices will always be valid and within the range of the sentence length.
The indices are zero-based.
The end indices are inclusive.
