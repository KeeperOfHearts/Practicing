class SimplifyClothingName {
    public static String simplifyClothingName(String fullName, int length) {
        fullName = fullName.toLowerCase().substring(0, Math.min(fullName.length(), 11)).replace(" ", "");
        if (length < 30) return "mini-" + fullName;

}

Create a function named simplifyClothingName that receives String fullName and int length as its parameters.

The function should simplify the name of a clothing item based on its full name and length. This challenge simulates a seamstress refining and renaming her latest creation.

Follow these steps to simplify the clothing name:

    Determine the prefix based on the length:
        If length is less than 30 cm, use "Mini-"
        If length is between 30 cm and 50 cm (inclusive), use "Regular-"
        If length is greater than 50 cm, use "Long-"
    Remove all spaces from the full name
    Keep only the first 10 characters of the name (after removing spaces)
    Convert the entire simplified name (prefix + modified name) to lowercase

Parameters:

    fullName (String): The original name of the clothing item. It will only contain alphabetic characters and spaces.
    length (int): The length of the clothing item in centimeters. It will be a positive integer.

The function returns a string representing the simplified name of the clothing item.
