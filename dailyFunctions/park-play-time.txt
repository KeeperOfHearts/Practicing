Create a function named parkPlaytime that receives names and activities as its parameters.

This function combines each child's name with their favorite park activity to create a playful message.

Iterate through the names and activities arrays, concatenating each name with its corresponding activity, separated by a space. Return the final concatenated string.

If the number of names and activities is not the same, combine up to the length of the shorter array.

Parameters:

names (String[]): An array of children's names.
activities (String[]): An array of activities each child enjoys (e.g., "swings", "slides").
Returns a String: the concatenated message of each child's name and their favorite activity, separated by spaces.
