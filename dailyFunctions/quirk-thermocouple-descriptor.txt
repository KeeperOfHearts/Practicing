        return String.format("In the dusty corners of our quirky hardware store, we discovered a... %s thermocouple, circa %d, capable of measuring up to %d°C. !%s!

Create a function named describeThermocouple that receives material, year, temperature, and quirk as its parameters.

Your task is to generate a quirky description of an antique thermocouple found in a small town's eccentric hardware store. The function should format and manipulate the input strings to create a cohesive and whimsical description of the thermocouple.

Follow these rules to create the description:

    Start the description with "In the dusty corners of our quirky hardware store, we discovered a..."
    The material should be in lowercase, except for the first letter which should be capitalized.
    The year should be formatted as "circa YYYY".
    The temperature should be rounded to the nearest whole number and formatted as "X°C".
    The quirk should be incorporated as is, but surrounded by exclamation marks.
    End the description with "A true antique marvel!"

Parameters:

    material (String): The material of the thermocouple (e.g., "copper", "iron", "platinum")
    year (int): The year the thermocouple was manufactured
    temperature (double): The maximum temperature the thermocouple can measure (in Celsius)
    quirk (String): A unique characteristic or quirk of the thermocouple

The function returns a String containing the formatted description of the thermocouple.
