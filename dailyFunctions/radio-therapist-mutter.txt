Create a function named radiotherapistMutter that receives patientNumber as its parameter.

The function simulates a radiotherapist's muttering while preparing for patients. It generates a string that represents the radiotherapist's thoughts, including the patient number, a substring of a predefined phrase, and a countdown.

Use the following predefined phrase: "Another day, another dose of radiation therapy."

The function should generate an output string in the format: "Patient {number}: {substring of phrase}... {countdown}"

Parameters:

    patientNumber (int): The current patient number (between 1 and 100, inclusive).

The function returns a string representing the radiotherapist's muttering.

Rules:

    Use the patient number to determine how much of the phrase to include in the output.
    Include a countdown from 5 to 1, representing the radiotherapist's mental preparation.
    Use basic substring operations to handle parts of the string.
    Utilize increment or decrement operators to manage the countdown.
