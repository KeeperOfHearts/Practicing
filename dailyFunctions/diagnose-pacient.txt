Create a function named diagnosePacient that receives symptoms as its parameter.

The function simulates a doctor's diagnosis based on a patient's symptoms. It analyzes the symptoms using substring checks and conditional statements to determine the diagnosis. The diagnosis is then returned as a string, with certain parts of the diagnosis reversed.

Parameters:

    symptoms (String): A string containing the patient's symptoms, separated by spaces. The string will be between 5 and 100 characters long.

The function returns a String representing the diagnosis and recommended actions.

Follow these steps to implement the function:

    Search for specific substrings within the input string to identify symptoms.
    Use nested if-else statements to determine the diagnosis based on the identified symptoms.
    Construct the diagnosis as a string, with certain keywords reversed.

Use the following rules for the diagnosis:

    If the symptoms contain "fever" and "cough", diagnose as "Flu".
    If the symptoms contain "headache" and "dizziness", diagnose as "Migraine".
    If the symptoms contain "sore throat" and "runny nose", diagnose as "Common Cold".
    For any other combination, diagnose as "Unknown Condition".

In the returned diagnosis string:

    Reverse the word "water" to "retaw".
    Reverse the word "days" to "syad".
    Reverse the name of the diagnosed condition.

Note: The function should be case-insensitive when checking for symptoms, but the output should maintain proper capitalization.
