Create a function named isBacterialCode that receives number and substring as its parameters.

In the laboratory of an overlarge scientist studying Eubacteriales, a unique coding system has been developed to classify bacterial strains. This system, called the "Bacterial Code", is based on specific numerical properties.

A number is considered a "Bacterial Code" if it satisfies two conditions:

It contains the given substring.
The sum of its digits is divisible by 7 (a number significant in microbiology due to bacterial growth patterns).
Your task is to implement this classification system.

Parameters:

number (int): A positive integer to be checked.
substring (String): A string to be searched for within the number.
The function returns a boolean value: true if the number is a Bacterial Code, and false otherwise.

Here's how to approach this problem:

Convert the number to a string.
Check if the string representation of the number contains the given substring.
Calculate the sum of the digits in the number.
Check if the sum is divisible by 7.
Return true if both conditions are met, false otherwise.
