Create a function named adjustMultivibratorFrequency that receives initialFrequencies and adjustments as its parameters.

In a dimly lit laboratory, a curious scientist is experimenting with a multivibrator circuit and wants to increase its frequency. Your task is to help the scientist by implementing a function that adjusts the frequency settings of the multivibrator.

The function should perform the following steps:

    Find the maximum value in the initialFrequencies array.
    Create a new array that concatenates the maximum value (repeated based on the length of the adjustments array) with the adjustments array.
    Return the new array representing the updated frequencies.

Parameters:

    initialFrequencies (int[]): An array of integers representing the initial frequency settings of the multivibrator.
    adjustments (int[]): An array of integers representing the adjustment values to be applied to the frequency.

The function returns an integer array (int[]) representing the updated frequencies after adjustment.

Constraints:

    The length of initialFrequencies will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    The length of adjustments will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    All values in both arrays will be non-negative integers less than or equal to 1000.
