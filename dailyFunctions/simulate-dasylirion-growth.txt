Create a function named simulateDasylirionGrowth that receives initialHeight, days, dailyGrowth, and waterSupply as its parameters.

The function simulates the growth of a Dasylirion plant observed by a night owl near a spring. It should use a loop to simulate the plant's growth over a specified number of days, considering the daily growth rate and water consumption.

Follow these steps to implement the function:

    Use a loop to iterate through each day of the simulation.
    Increment the plant's height by the daily growth rate (converting millimeters to centimeters).
    Decrease the water supply by 50 milliliters per day (the plant's water consumption).
    If the water supply reaches 0, stop the plant's growth for the remaining days.
    Use basic increment and decrement operators to update the plant's height and water supply.

Parameters:

    initialHeight (int): The initial height of the Dasylirion plant in centimeters.
    days (int): The number of days to simulate the growth.
    dailyGrowth (int): The daily growth of the plant in millimeters.
    waterSupply (int): The initial water supply from the spring in milliliters.

The function returns a string message with the following information:

    The final height of the plant in centimeters (rounded to 2 decimal places)
    The remaining water supply in milliliters
    A message from the owl's perspective about the plant's growth
