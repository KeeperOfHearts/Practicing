Create a function named inspectWheatField that receives farmerName and wheatStalkCount as its parameters.

The function simulates a farmer's morning routine of inspecting wheat stalks at sunrise. It performs string reversal and basic arithmetic operations based on the farmer's name and the number of wheat stalks inspected.

The function should do the following:

    Reverse the farmer's name (to represent looking at things from a different perspective).
    Calculate the "golden ratio" of wheat stalks by dividing the number of wheat stalks by 1.618 (the golden ratio).
    Calculate the "sunrise bonus" by adding the length of the reversed name to the number of wheat stalks.
    Return a formatted string with the results.

Parameters:

    farmerName (String): The name of the farmer (non-empty string).
    wheatStalkCount (int): The number of wheat stalks inspected (positive integer).

The function returns a string in the following format:

"Farmer [reversed name] inspected [wheatStalkCount] stalks. Golden ratio: [goldenRatio], Sunrise bonus: [sunriseBonus]"

Note: Round the golden ratio to two decimal places.
