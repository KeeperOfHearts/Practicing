Create a function named teaPartyChallenge that receives hostName, guestCount, and costPerGuest as its parameters.

Imagine you're hosting a cozy afternoon tea party with your fluffy husky puppy, Whiskers. You need to calculate the total cost of the party and create a fun message for your guests.

Your function should perform the following tasks:

    Calculate the total cost of the tea party by multiplying the number of guests by the cost per guest.
    Add an extra 10% to the total cost for Whiskers' special treats.
    Reverse the host's name to create a playful "secret code".
    Return a formatted string that includes the reversed name and the total cost.

Parameters:

    hostName (String): The name of the host.
    guestCount (int): The number of guests attending the party.
    costPerGuest (float): The cost per guest for tea and snacks.

The function returns a string in the format: "Dear [reversed host name], your tea party will cost $[total cost]."

Make sure to round the total cost to two decimal places.
