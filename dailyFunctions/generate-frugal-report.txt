Create a function named generateFrugalReport that receives name, budget, and spent as its parameters.

The function should generate a "Frugal Student Report" based on a student's daily spending and savings. This report will help students track their frugal lifestyle while pursuing their baccalaureate degree.

The function should perform the following tasks:

    Calculate the amount saved (budget - spent)
    Determine if the student was frugal (spent less than or equal to the budget)
    Calculate the percentage of the budget saved
    Generate a report string that includes all this information

The report should include the following information:

    Student's name
    Whether they were frugal or not
    Amount saved
    Percentage of budget saved (rounded to two decimal places)
    A special message based on their frugality

Parameters:

    name (String): The name of the student.
    budget (int): The student's daily budget in dollars.
    spent (int): The actual amount spent in dollars.

The function returns a string containing the "Frugal Student Report".

Special messages based on frugality:

    If the student saved more than 50% of their budget: "Excellent frugality!"
    If the student saved between 20% and 50% of their budget: "Good job saving!"
    If the student saved between 0% and 20% of their budget: "Try to save more next time."
    If the student overspent: "Be more careful with your spending."
