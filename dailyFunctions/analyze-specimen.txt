Create a function named analyzeSpecimen that receives specimenType and reactionLevel as its parameters.

The function simulates a scientist's analysis of a specimen in a laboratory. It should return a string that describes the analysis result based on the specimen type and reaction level.

Use basic string concatenation and conditional statements (if-else) to determine the appropriate response. The analysis should cover three types of specimens: bacteria, virus, and fungus. For any other specimen type, return a message indicating it's unknown.

Parameters:

    specimenType (String): The type of specimen being analyzed (e.g., "bacteria", "virus", "fungus").
    reactionLevel (int): An integer representing the observed reaction level, ranging from 1 to 5.

The function returns a string describing the analysis result.

Use the following criteria for your analysis:

    For bacteria:
        Low reaction levels (1-2): "Minimal bacterial activity observed."
        Medium reaction levels (3-4): "Moderate bacterial growth detected."
        High reaction level (5): "Significant bacterial proliferation identified."
    For viruses:
        Low reaction levels (1-2): "Low viral load detected."
        Medium reaction levels (3-4): "Moderate viral activity observed."
        High reaction level (5): "High viral replication rate confirmed."
    For fungi:
        Low reaction levels (1-2): "Slight fungal presence noted."
        Medium reaction levels (3-4): "Moderate fungal growth observed."
        High reaction level (5): "Extensive fungal colonization detected."
    For any other specimen type: "Unknown specimen type. Further analysis required."
