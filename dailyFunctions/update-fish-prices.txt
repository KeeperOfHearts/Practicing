Create a function named updateFishPrices that receives fishWeights and basePricePerKg as its parameters.

You are a fisherman at a coastal market, and you need to update the price tags on freshly caught coalfish. Your task is to create a function that calculates the new prices based on the weight of each fish and a base price per kilogram.

Use nested loops to process the 2D array of fish weights and calculate their new prices according to the following rules:

For fish weighing less than 500 grams: base price per kg
For fish weighing 500 grams or more but less than 1000 grams: base price per kg + 10% premium
For fish weighing 1000 grams or more: base price per kg + 20% premium
Parameters:

fishWeights (int[][]): A 2D array where each element represents the weight of a fish in grams.
basePricePerKg (int): The base price per kilogram of coalfish in cents.
The function returns a 2D integer array with the same dimensions as the input, where each element represents the updated price of the corresponding fish in cents.
