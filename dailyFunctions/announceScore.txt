Create a function named announceScore that receives playerName and score as its parameters.

Your task is to generate an exciting arcade-style announcement for a player's score. This function will combine the player's name and their score into a fun, celebratory message that could be displayed on an arcade screen.

Use string concatenation to create a message in the following format: "Woohoo! [playerName] just scored [score] points! High five!"

Parameters:

    playerName (String): The name of the player who achieved the score.
    score (int): The score achieved by the player.

The function returns a String containing the formatted announcement message.
