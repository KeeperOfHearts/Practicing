class CatAction {
    public static String catAction(String catName, String preyName, String kitchenSound) {
        return String.format("%s the cat pounced on the %s while the %s echoed in the busy kitchen.", catName, preyName, kitchenSound);
    }
}

Create a function named catAction that receives catName, preyName, and kitchenSound as its parameters.

The function should generate a descriptive sentence about a cat's action in a kitchen environment by manipulating and concatenating the input strings.

Combine the input strings to form a sentence that follows this pattern: "[catName] the cat pounced on the [preyName] while the [kitchenSound] echoed in the busy kitchen."

Parameters:

    catName (String): The name of the cat (e.g., "Whiskers", "Mittens")
    preyName (String): The name of the prey (e.g., "mouse", "toy")
    kitchenSound (String): A sound typically heard in a kitchen (e.g., "sizzle", "clang")

The function returns a String containing the generated sentence.
