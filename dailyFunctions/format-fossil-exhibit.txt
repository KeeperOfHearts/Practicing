Create a function named formatFossilExhibit that receives name, age, discoveredBy, and isComplete as its parameters.

The function should format the information about a fossil exhibit in a natural history museum, incorporating details about its completeness, name, age, and discoverer.

Use string formatting to compile the fossil information into a user-friendly string. Apply logical operators to determine if the fossil should be noted as a complete specimen and if it's considered ancient.

Parameters:

    name (String): The name of the fossil.
    age (int): The age of the fossil in millions of years.
    discoveredBy (String): The name of the paleontologist who discovered the fossil.
    isComplete (boolean): A boolean indicating whether the fossil is a complete specimen.

The function returns a formatted string providing the fossil details.

Format the string as follows:

    Start with either "Complete specimen:" or "Partial specimen:" based on the isComplete parameter.
    Include the fossil's name.
    If the fossil is older than 100 million years, add "Ancient" before the age; otherwise, just state the age.
    Add "million years old" after the age.
    Include the discoverer's name at the end.
