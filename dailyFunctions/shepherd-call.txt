class ShepherdCall {
    public static String shepherdCall(String shepherdName, int sheepCount) {
        return String.format("%s calls: %s! %s", shepherdName , new StringBuilder(shepherdName).reverse().toString(), "baa ".repeat(sheepCount).substring(0, sheepCount*4-1));
    }
}

Create a function named shepherdCall that receives shepherdName (String) and sheepCount (int) as its parameters.

The function simulates a shepherd's call to his sheep on a hillside. It should return a formatted string that includes the shepherd's name (both forward and reversed) and a series of "baa" sounds based on the number of sheep.

The function should perform the following operations:

    Reverse the shepherdName.
    Create a string of "baa" sounds, repeated sheepCount times.
    Format the output string as follows: "[shepherdName] calls: [reversedShepherdName]! [baa x sheepCount]"

Parameters:

    shepherdName (String): The name of the shepherd. It will contain only basic ASCII letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and will have a length of at least 1 and at most 50 characters.
    sheepCount (int): The number of sheep in the flock. It will be a positive integer not exceeding 20.

The function returns a formatted string as described above.

Here's an example of how to reverse a string in Java:


String reversed = new StringBuilder(original).reverse().toString();

And here's how you can repeat a string in Java:


String repeated = "baa ".repeat(count).trim();
