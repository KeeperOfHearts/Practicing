Create a function named processUnsignedCheck that receives checkAmount, checkDimensions, checkAge, geometricShapes, and foldCount as its parameters.

The function simulates a complex financial calculation system for an old-fashioned bank, processing unsigned checks and performing various geometric and arithmetic operations to determine the final value and validity of each check.

Implement the following calculations and validations:

    Convert the check amount to a fraction and multiply it by (checkAge + 1) / checkAge.
    Calculate the surface area and volume of the check using the given dimensions.
    Apply a 2% increase to the check value for each fold.
    Calculate the areas of the geometric shapes drawn on the check and use them to adjust the check value. For simplicity, assume:
        Triangle area = 0.5 * base * height (use 10 for base and height)
        Circle area = π * r^2 (use 5 for radius)
        Square area = side^2 (use 10 for side length)
    Add the total area of shapes to the check value.
    Raise the check value to the power of the number of shapes, then take the nth root where n is the number of folds.
    Implement a validation algorithm: the check is valid if the product of its dimensions is greater than 1,000,000 and the number of shapes is less than 5.
    Format the final adjusted value as a percentage of the original value.

Parameters:

    checkAmount (String): The original amount on the check (e.g., "1234.56").
    checkDimensions (int[]): An array containing the length, width, and height of the check in millimeters.
    checkAge (float): The age of the check in years.
    geometricShapes (String[]): An array of strings representing geometric shapes drawn on the check (e.g., ["triangle", "circle", "square"]).
    foldCount (int): The number of folds in the check.

The function returns a string containing the adjusted check value, validity status, and geometric properties in the following format:

"Adjusted Value: X%, Valid: true/false, Surface Area: Y mm², Volume: Z mm³"

Where X is the adjusted value as a percentage of the original (rounded to 2 decimal places), Y is the surface area (rounded to 2 decimal places), and Z is the volume (rounded to 2 decimal places).
