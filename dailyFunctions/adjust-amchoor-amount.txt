class AdjustAmchoorAmount {
    public static int adjustAmchoorAmount(int currentAmount, int adjustment) {
        return Math.min(100, currentAmount+adjustment);
    }
}

Create a function named adjustAmchoorAmount that receives currentAmount and adjustment as its parameters.

You are a chef in a minimalist kitchen, experimenting with amchoor spice to perfect your dish. Your task is to create a function that adjusts the amount of amchoor spice based on the current amount and a given adjustment value.

The function should increase or decrease the amount of amchoor based on the adjustment value, but with some constraints to reflect your careful experimentation:

    The amount of amchoor should never go below 0 grams (you can't have negative spice!).
    The maximum amount of amchoor should be limited to 100 grams (to prevent over-spicing).

Parameters:

    currentAmount (int): The current amount of amchoor spice in grams.
    adjustment (int): The adjustment value. A positive value means adding more spice, while a negative value means reducing the amount.

The function returns an integer representing the new amount of amchoor after the adjustment, ensuring it stays within the range of 0 to 100 grams.

Use increment (++) or decrement (--) operators at least once in your solution to practice these basic operators.
