Write a function updateBirdFeedStock that takes initialStock, unitsSold and returns a formatted string with binary representation and updated stock.

The function updates the bird feed inventory by subtracting sold units, converts the sold amount to binary, then increments the remaining stock by 1 for tomorrow's delivery.

Parameters:

    initialStock (int): Starting number of bird feed bags
    unitsSold (int): Number of bags sold today

Returns: Formatted string with binary representation of sold units and final stock count. Format: Binary: [binary] New Count: [decimal]
