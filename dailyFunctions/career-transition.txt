class CareerTransition {
    public static String careerTransition(int days) {
        if (days >= 15) return "The shoesmith wrote 130 lines of code and learned 5 programming concepts.";
        return String.format("The shoesmith wrote %d lines of code and learned %d programming concepts.", (int) (days-days/7)*10, days/3);
    }
}

Create a function named careerTransition that receives days as its parameter.

The function simulates a shoesmith's transition to a new career as a programmer. It tracks the shoesmith's progress in learning programming concepts over a given number of days.

Use a loop to iterate through the days, employing basic control flow (break, continue) and increment/decrement operators to track the shoesmith's progress. The challenge focuses on using these basic concepts to create a narrative of the shoesmith's journey.

Parameters:

    days (int): The number of days since the shoesmith started learning programming.

The function returns a String describing the shoesmith's progress in learning programming concepts.

Follow these steps to implement the function:

    Initialize variables to track the shoesmith's progress (e.g., lines of code written, concepts learned).
    Use a loop to iterate through the days.
    For each day, increment or decrement progress variables based on certain conditions.
    Use break or continue statements to simulate setbacks or breakthroughs in the learning process.
    After the loop, return a string that summarizes the shoesmith's progress.

Implement the following logic in your function:

    Every day, the shoesmith writes 10 lines of code.
    Every 3 days, the shoesmith learns a new concept.
    If the day is divisible by 7, the shoesmith takes a break and doesn't code (use continue).
    If the shoesmith has learned 5 concepts, they have a breakthrough and the learning process ends (use break).

The returned string should include the total lines of code written and the number of concepts learned.
