Create a function named adjustLivingRoom that receives curtains and radiatorSettings as its parameters.

Your task is to simulate adjusting the coziness of a living room by manipulating curtains and a radiator. The function should perform the following operations:

    "Open" the curtains by replacing the first three and last three '|' characters with '-' characters. If there are fewer than three '|' characters on either side, replace as many as possible.
    Calculate the average heat setting of the radiator by summing all elements in the radiatorSettings array and dividing by the number of elements.

Parameters:

    curtains (String): A string of 10 characters representing the curtains. Each character can be either '|' (closed) or '-' (open).
    radiatorSettings (int[]): An array of 5 integers (0-5) representing the current heat settings of a five-bar radiator.

The function returns a String describing the state of the curtains and the average heat setting of the radiator in the format: "Curtains: [curtain_state], Average heat: [average_heat]", where [curtain_state] is the modified curtain string and [average_heat] is rounded to one decimal place.

Constraints:

    The curtains string will always have exactly 10 characters.
    The radiatorSettings array will always have exactly 5 integers.
    Each integer in radiatorSettings will be between 0 and 5 (inclusive).

Hints:

    Use substring operations to manipulate the curtains string.
    Use a loop to count and replace '|' characters in the curtains string.
    Use array operations to calculate the average of radiatorSettings.
    Use String.format() to round the average heat to one decimal place.
