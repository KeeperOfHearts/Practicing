Create a function named analyzeChildSymptoms that receives symptomDescription and previousAttempts as its parameters.

Your task is to implement a function that analyzes a child's attempt to deceive their parents about being sick. The function should use advanced string manipulation and game theory concepts to determine if the child is likely faking or genuinely ill.

The challenge involves parsing a reversed string of symptoms, identifying key phrases even when misspelled or obfuscated, and applying game theory principles to assess the likelihood of the child's strategy being successful.

Parameters:

    symptomDescription (String): A reversed string representing the child's description of their symptoms. This string may contain misspellings and obfuscated words (e.g., "r,e.v:e;f" for "fever").
    previousAttempts (int): The number of previous attempts the child has made to fake illness, representing a "parental suspicion" factor.

The function should perform the following steps:

    Reverse the symptomDescription string to obtain the actual description.
    Parse the reversed string to identify symptom-related words and phrases, even when misspelled or obfuscated.
    Assign weights to various symptoms and their combinations based on their likelihood of being faked or genuine.
    Apply game theory principles to assess the child's strategy, taking into account the number of previous attempts.
    Calculate a "genuineness score" based on the identified symptoms and their weights.
    Determine the final diagnosis and confidence level based on the genuineness score and previous attempts.

The function returns a String in the format "[Diagnosis]: [Confidence]%", where [Diagnosis] is one of "Genuinely Ill", "Possibly Faking", or "Definitely Faking", and [Confidence] is an integer between 0 and 100.

Note: Implement the solution using only the allowed Java types and ensure your code is between 20 and 49 lines long.
