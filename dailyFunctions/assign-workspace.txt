class AssignWorkspace {
    public static String assignWorkspace(String departmentCode, int roomNumber) {
        if ((roomNumber & 1) == 0) departmentCode = new StringBuilder(departmentCode).reverse().toString();
        return departmentCode + "-" + roomNumber;
    }
}

Write a function assignWorkspace that takes departmentCode, roomNumber and returns a workspace identifier string.

The function creates workspace identifiers for the new office by processing department codes based on room number conditions and concatenating them with room numbers.

Logic:

    If the room number is even, reverse the department code
    If the room number is odd, keep the department code as-is
    Concatenate the processed department code with the room number using a dash separator

Parameters:

    departmentCode (String): The department identifier code
    roomNumber (int): The room number for the workspace

Returns: A workspace identifier string. Format: processedDepartmentCode-roomNumber
