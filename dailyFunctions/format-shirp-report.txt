class FormatShrimpReport {
    public static String formatShrimpReport(String speciesName, int count, float length, String color, String habitat) {
        return String.format("Shrimp Species: %s\nCount: %s\nAverage Length: %s cm\nColor: %s\nHabitat: %s", speciesName, count, Math.round(length*10)/10.0, color, habitat);
    }
}

Create a function named formatShrimpReport that receives speciesName, count, length, color, and habitat as its parameters.

The function should format the input information into a structured report for a curious bird watcher observing rare shrimp species at a coastal wetland.

Format the report as follows:

"Shrimp Species: [speciesName]\nCount: [count]\nAverage Length: [length] cm\nColor: [color]\nHabitat: [habitat]"

Make sure to format the length to one decimal place.

Parameters:

    speciesName (String): The name of the shrimp species observed.
    count (int): The number of shrimp observed.
    length (float): The average length of the shrimp in centimeters.
    color (String): The primary color of the shrimp.
    habitat (String): The specific habitat where the shrimp were observed.

The function returns a String containing the formatted shrimp report.
