Create a function named plantHealthStatus that receives hydrationLevel and sunlightHours as its parameters.

This function determines the health status of a plant based on its hydration level and sunlight exposure.

The function should return a String indicating the health of the plant according to the following conditions:

    Return "Healthy" if hydrationLevel is between 60 and 80 inclusive, and sunlightHours is between 6 and 8 inclusive.
    Return "Dehydrated" if hydrationLevel is below 60, regardless of sunlight exposure.
    Return "Waterlogged" if hydrationLevel is above 80, regardless of sunlight exposure.
    Return "Sunburned" if sunlightHours are above 8, unless it is also waterlogged.
    Return "Needs more light" if sunlightHours are less than 6, unless it is dehydrated or waterlogged.

Parameters:

    hydrationLevel (int): The percentage of water content in the plant, where 100 is perfectly hydrated. It will be between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    sunlightHours (int): The number of hours the plant was exposed to sunlight in a day. It will be between 0 and 24 inclusive.

The function returns a String representing the health status of the plant.
