Create a function named recommendPlantType that receives temperature and soilType as its parameters.

This function aims to recommend a type of plant based on the given temperature and soil type conditions in a backyard garden.

The function should follow these guidelines:

    If the temperature is less than 15 degrees Celsius and soilType is "clay", recommend "Ferns".
    If the temperature is between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius (inclusive) and soilType is "loamy", recommend "Roses".
    If the temperature is greater than 25 degrees Celsius and soilType is "sandy", recommend "Cacti".
    For any other combination of temperature and soilType, recommend "Grass".

Parameters:

    temperature (int): The average temperature of the backyard garden in degrees Celsius.
    soilType (String): The type of soil in the backyard garden. It can be one of the following values: "clay", "sandy", or "loamy".

The function returns a String representing the recommended plant type based on the given temperature and soil conditions.
