Create a function named updateSketchProgress that receives currentSketch, artistEnergy, and isDarkening as its parameters.

The function simulates a sketch artist's progress in the park, determining whether they continue sketching, take a break, or finish for the day based on their current state, energy level, and lighting conditions.

Parameters:

    currentSketch (String): Represents the current state of the sketch. Possible values are "outline", "half-done", or "almost complete".
    artistEnergy (int): Represents the artist's energy level, ranging from 0 to 100.
    isDarkening (boolean): Indicates if it's getting darker outside (true) or not (false).

The function returns a String indicating the next state of the sketch or the artist's action based on the following rules:

    If the artist's energy is below 20, return "Taking a break" regardless of other factors.
    If it's getting darker and the sketch is not "almost complete", return "Finishing for today".
    If the current sketch is "outline" and energy is above 50, return "half-done".
    If the current sketch is "half-done" and energy is above 30, return "almost complete".
    If the current sketch is "almost complete" and energy is above 10, return "masterpiece finished".
    In any other case, return the current state of the sketch.
