Create a function named determineQuatrefoilComplexity that receives lobes as its parameter.

As a medieval artisan, you are tasked with categorizing quatrefoil designs for church windows based on their complexity. The complexity is determined by the number of lobes in the design.

Your function should return a string describing the complexity of the quatrefoil design based on the following criteria:

    3 lobes or less: "Simple design"
    4 lobes: "Classic quatrefoil"
    5-6 lobes: "Complex design"
    7 or more lobes: "Masterpiece"

Parameters:

    lobes (int): The number of lobes in the quatrefoil design. This will always be a positive integer.

The function returns a String representing the complexity category of the quatrefoil design.

Use conditional statements (if, else if, else) to implement this logic.
