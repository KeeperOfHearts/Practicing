Create a function named calculateLockerRankness that receives workoutIntensity, workoutDuration, and consecutiveDays as its parameters.

The function simulates a professional athlete's training schedule and calculates the "rankness" level of their locker based on the intensity and duration of their workouts over consecutive days.

Calculate the rankness score using the following formula:


rankness = (workoutIntensity * workoutDuration * consecutiveDays) / 2

Then, determine the rankness description based on the calculated score:

    0-20: "Fresh as a daisy"
    21-40: "Slight whiff"
    41-60: "Noticeable odor"
    61-80: "Pungent aroma"
    81-100: "Hazardous environment"
    >100: "Biohazard alert!"

Parameters:

    workoutIntensity (int): A value from 1 to 10 representing the intensity of the athlete's daily workout.
    workoutDuration (int): The number of hours the athlete trains each day.
    consecutiveDays (int): The number of consecutive days the athlete has been training.

The function returns a formatted string describing the state of the locker in the following format:


"After {consecutiveDays} days of intense training, the locker's rankness level is: {ranknessDescription}"

Where {consecutiveDays} is the input value and {ranknessDescription} is based on the calculated rankness score.
