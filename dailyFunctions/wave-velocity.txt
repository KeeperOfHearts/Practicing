class WaveVelocity {
    public static float waveVelocity(float wavelength, float depth) {
        return (float)Math.sqrt(9.8f * wavelength / (float) (2 * Math.PI) * (float) Math.tanh((float)(2 * Math.PI * depth / wavelength)));
    }
}

Create a function named waveVelocity that receives wavelength and depth as its parameters.

This function calculates the velocity of a wave based on its wavelength and the depth of the water using the formula:

velocity = Math.sqrt(g * wavelength / (2 * Math.PI) * Math.tanh(2 * Math.PI * depth / wavelength))

Where:

    g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2)
    wavelength is the distance between two successive crests of the wave
    depth is the depth of the water

Steps to implement:

    Calculate 2 * Math.PI and store it.
    Calculate 2 * Math.PI * depth / wavelength and store it.
    Apply Math.tanh() to the result of step 2.
    Multiply the result of step 3 by g * wavelength / (2 * Math.PI).
    Apply Math.sqrt() to the result of step 4 to get the final velocity.

Return the calculated velocity as a float value.

Parameters:

    wavelength (float): The wavelength of the wave in meters.
    depth (float): The depth of the water in meters.

The function returns a float value representing the velocity of the wave in meters per second.
