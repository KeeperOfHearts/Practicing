Create a function named planClumsyEscape that receives exhibits and magicWord as its parameters.

Your task is to simulate planning a clumsy escape route through a natural history museum. The function should create a string representing the escape route based on the given exhibits, but with some special rules.

Follow these steps to create the escape route:

    Split the exhibits string into an array of individual exhibit names.
    Iterate through each exhibit name:
        If the exhibit name contains the letter 'o' (case-sensitive), skip it using the continue statement.
        If the exhibit name matches the magicWord (case-sensitive), immediately end the plan using the break statement.
        Otherwise, add the exhibit name to the escape route.
    Join the selected exhibits in the escape route with " -> ".
    If the escape route is empty (all exhibits skipped or magic word encountered immediately), return "Oops! Back to the drawing board!".

Parameters:

    exhibits (String): A comma-separated list of exhibit names in the museum.
    magicWord (String): A word that, when encountered, immediately ends the escape plan.

The function returns a String representing the clumsy escape route or "Oops! Back to the drawing board!" if the route is empty.
