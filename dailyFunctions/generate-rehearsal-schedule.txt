Create a function named generateRehearsalSchedule that receives numberOfGroups and availableDays as its parameters.

The function should generate a rehearsal schedule for musical groups in a small-town community center.

Use nested loops and basic logical operators to create a schedule where each group gets to rehearse on different days. If there are more groups than available days, some groups will have to share days.

Parameters:

numberOfGroups (int): The number of musical groups (1 to 5)
availableDays (int): The number of days available for rehearsals (1 to 7)
The function returns a string array representing the rehearsal schedule. Each string in the array should follow the format "Day X: Group Y" or "Day X: No rehearsal" if no group is scheduled for that day.

Handle cases where there might be more groups than days or vice versa. Ensure that each group gets a fair chance to rehearse, and distribute the rehearsal slots as evenly as possible.
