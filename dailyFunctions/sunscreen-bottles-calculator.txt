}

Create a function named calculateSunscreenBottles that receives totalHours and usagePerHour as parameters.

This function calculates the number of full sunscreen bottles needed for a beach trip based on the total hours spent at the beach and the amount of sunscreen used per hour.

Steps:

    Multiply totalHours by usagePerHour to get the total amount of sunscreen needed in milliliters.
    Divide the total amount of sunscreen by the capacity of each bottle (100 ml) to get the number of bottles.
    Round up the result to the nearest whole number.

Parameters:

    totalHours (int): Total hours at the beach.
    usagePerHour (int): Amount of sunscreen in milliliters used per hour.

The function returns an integer representing the number of full sunscreen bottles needed.
