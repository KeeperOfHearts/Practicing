Create a function named generateBowlingMessage that receives playerName and score as its parameters.

The function should generate a custom bowling scorecard message for a player at the local candlepin bowling alley. It will return a personalized message that includes a greeting, the player's score, and a fun comment based on their performance.

Use string manipulation and concatenation to create the message. The message should have three parts: a greeting with the player's name, their score, and a comment based on their performance.

Parameters:

playerName (String): The name of the player.
score (int): The player's bowling score (0-300).
The function returns a string containing the personalized message.

Use the following performance comments based on the score:

Score 0-50: "Keep practicing!"
Score 51-100: "Nice effort!"
Score 101-150: "Great job!"
Score 151-200: "Wow, you're a natural!"
Score 201-300: "Perfect game! You're a bowling champion!"
Make sure to handle any leading or trailing whitespace in the player's name.
