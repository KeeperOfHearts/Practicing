Create a function named examineCurio that receives itemName as its parameter.

The function simulates a cautious visitor examining a curious item in an antique shop. It should return a modified version of the item name that reflects the visitor's careful examination.

Follow these steps to create the examined version of the item name:

Create a new string to store the examined version of the item name.
Iterate through each character in the original item name:
If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u - case insensitive), add it twice to the examined name.
If it's a consonant, add it once to the examined name.
If it's a space, add three periods (...) to represent careful pausing.
Return the examined name string.
Parameters:

itemName (String): The name of the antique item to be examined.
The function returns a String representing the examined version of the item name.
