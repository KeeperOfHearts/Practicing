Create a function named findOptimalGreenhouse that receives temperature, humidity, and sunlight as its parameters.

This function aims to determine the optimal greenhouse for a plant species based on its environmental requirements.

The botanical garden has three greenhouses with specific conditions:

    Greenhouse A: Temperature > 25°C, Humidity > 60%, Full sunlight
    Greenhouse B: Temperature between 15°C and 25°C (inclusive), Humidity between 40% and 60% (inclusive), Partial sunlight
    Greenhouse C: Temperature < 15°C, Humidity < 40%, Shade

Implement the function to take the given environmental factors and return the appropriate greenhouse for the plant.

Use the following criteria to determine the greenhouse:

    If the temperature is above 25°C, humidity is above 60%, and the plant requires full sunlight, it should be placed in Greenhouse A.
    If the temperature is between 15°C and 25°C (inclusive), humidity is between 40% and 60% (inclusive), and the plant requires partial sunlight, it should be placed in Greenhouse B.
    If the temperature is below 15°C, humidity is below 40%, and the plant requires shade, it should be placed in Greenhouse C.
    If the environmental factors do not match any of the greenhouse criteria, return "No suitable greenhouse".

Note: The sunlight parameter will be provided as a string, either "Full", "Partial", or "Shade".

Parameters:

    temperature (int): The temperature requirement of the plant species in degrees Celsius.
    humidity (int): The humidity requirement of the plant species in percentage.
    sunlight (String): The sunlight requirement of the plant species, either "Full", "Partial", or "Shade".

The function returns a string indicating the optimal greenhouse for the plant species based on the provided environmental factors. If no suitable greenhouse is found, it returns "No suitable greenhouse".
