Create a function named categorizeCreature that receives creatureName as its parameter.

Imagine you're a curious child exploring a magical garden. You've discovered a way to give special names to the tiny creatures you find. Your task is to create a function that takes the name of a garden creature, reverses it, and then adds a special category based on how long the reversed name is.

Here's how to solve this magical naming puzzle:

    First, reverse the name of the creature.
    Count how many letters are in the reversed name.
    Based on the length of the reversed name, add a special category:
        If the reversed name has 1-3 letters: add "Tiny" in front
        If it has 4-6 letters: add "Small" in front
        If it has 7-9 letters: add "Medium" in front
        If it has 10 or more letters: add "Large" in front
    Return the category followed by a space and then the reversed name.

Parameters:

    creatureName (String): The name of the garden creature you want to categorize. It will only contain lowercase letters.

The function returns a String that contains the category and the reversed name, separated by a space.
