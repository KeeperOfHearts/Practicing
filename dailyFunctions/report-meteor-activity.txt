Create a function named reportMeteorActivity that receives initialCount and adjustments as its parameters.

You are a pirate captain using an old handset phone to report strange meteoritic activity at sea. Your task is to create a function that simulates the reporting process, keeping track of meteor sightings and identifying special numbers during the count.

Parameters:

    initialCount (int): The initial number of meteors sighted (1 ≤ initialCount ≤ 100).
    adjustments (int): The number of times you adjust the meteor count (0 ≤ adjustments ≤ 50).

The function should perform the following steps:

    Start with the initialCount of meteors.
    For each adjustment:
        If the current count is even, increment the count by 1.
        If the current count is odd, decrement the count by 1.
    After each adjustment, check if the current count is a special number:
        7: Lucky number
        13: Unlucky number
        21: Pirate's favorite number
    Keep track of any special numbers encountered during the adjustments.

The function returns a string in the following format:

"Final count: [finalCount], Special numbers encountered: [specialNumbers]"

Where [finalCount] is the final number of meteors after all adjustments, and [specialNumbers] is a comma-separated list of special numbers encountered (in the order they were encountered) or "None" if no special numbers were encountered.

Note: Use the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators for adjusting the count.
