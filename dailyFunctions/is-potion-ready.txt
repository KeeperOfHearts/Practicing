Create a function named isPotionReady that receives color and temperature as its parameters.

You are a curious chef experimenting with magical potions in your dimly lit kitchen. You've found an ancient cookbook that describes the perfect conditions for different potions. Your task is to determine whether a potion is ready based on its color and temperature.

The potion is considered ready under the following conditions:

    If the color is "red" and the temperature is above 100 degrees Celsius
    If the color is "blue" and the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius
    If the color is "green" and the temperature is exactly 25 degrees Celsius

For any other color or temperature combination, the potion is not ready.

Parameters:

    color (String): The color of the potion (e.g., "red", "blue", "green")
    temperature (int): The temperature of the potion in degrees Celsius

The function returns a boolean value: true if the potion is ready, false otherwise.
