Create a function named classifySeaweed that receives length, branches, and hasAirBladders as its parameters.

As a botanist at a coastal research station, you're tasked with classifying seaweed specimens based on their characteristics. Your function should return a string that classifies the seaweed into one of four categories: "Rhexia", "Desmarestia", "Unknown Species A", or "Unknown Species B".

Use the following classification rules:

    If the seaweed is longer than 50 cm AND has more than 10 branches, classify it as "Rhexia".
    If the seaweed has air bladders OR is shorter than 30 cm, classify it as "Desmarestia".
    If the seaweed is between 30 and 50 cm (inclusive) AND has 5 to 10 branches (inclusive), classify it as "Unknown Species A".
    For all other cases, classify it as "Unknown Species B".

Parameters:

    length (int): The length of the seaweed in centimeters.
    branches (int): The number of branches the seaweed has.
    hasAirBladders (boolean): Indicates whether the seaweed has air bladders (true) or not (false).

The function returns a String representing the classification of the seaweed specimen.
